**PIPELINE** is an annual not-for-profit one day conference focussed on Continuous Delivery, held each spring at etc.venues Victoria in London.

We are committed to conference diversity, with a 50/50 male/female committee, a proven way to improve the gender balance at tech conferences, and we’re aiming for substantial representation by women at the event. We also have a Code Of Conduct in addition to a blind speaker submission process.
